# Time Converter
An Android app to convert the time from different timezones

# Why I'm Making This
As a gamer who doesn't live in the USA, I often see announcements from games about maintenance and patches that come with timezones such as PDT and PST. I can never seem to remember how many hours behind PDT and PST are, so I decided to make an app.

Also, it's simple enough to be my very first Android app.
